Based on some personal reasons, I decided to have a road trip on weakend by myself. The destination was chosed to be Little Rock city & [Hot Springs National Park][hotsprings]. 

Though about 4.5 hours are needed to drive from Dallas to Little Rock City, the sunshiny sky, wispy cloud and the green colors around the road give me a bright heart. The interstate 30(I-30) is a two road highway, so the slower car should keep in the right line. Most of the drivers did very well in it, however, a minority of slower cars do not run on the right line. Consequently, there is a relatively low speed and long lines on the road, occasionally.

I booked the Burgundy hotel through [AAA][aaa]. The front desk of the hotel is really a nice lady who provided a lot of advices and guides to me, some of the advices I have never seen in the Internet.

The first place I went in the Little Rock City is [the Big Dam Bridge][bigdambridge]. The Big Dam bridge across the Arkansas River. It is the longest pedestrain/bicycle bridge in the world and is also the only bridge ever built into a dam. I do not know how difficult it would be to build a bridge into a dam, but as it is unique, I suppose it is something amazing. ![big dam bridge]({{site.url}}/img/blog/littlerock/bigdambridge.jpg) Just like San Xia in Long River in China, after build the dam, the water level of the river increases, the scene near the dam changes, the ecosphere in this area changes, the diveristy of living things in this area increases.  Although without enough time to confirm all these subjects, the scene on the bridge is amazing, this is enough for our tourists.

The second place I went to the Arkansas State Captial. According to the information from internet, this building often appears in movies. As it was not an appropriate time, I was unable to enter the building.

The third place I went is [Rock Town Distillery][rocktown]. The Rock Town Whisky is came out of here. In this distillery, we can participate in a tour. In the tour, we would be able to know how the whisky, vodeka, rum and gin are produced, and equipments used to produce the liquor would be showed. After the tour, everybody would be able to have a try on 15 different kind of liquors, mostly are whisky.

As Little Rock City is the president clinton's hometown, so [Clinton Presidential Museum][clintonmuseum] is the place worth going. The Clinton Presidential Park Bridge is located outside the museum. This bridge was built in 1899 and originally for the railroad. After the bankruptcy of the Rock Island Line on 1975, the bridge and the line was used by Spaghetti Warchouse restaurant chain. On 2002, the William J.Clinton Foundation leased the station from the City of Little Rock. On 2010, the City of Little Rock officially changed the name of the bridge to ghe Clinton Presidential Park Bridge. This bridge now is printed in almost all the brochures related to the City of Little Rock. Inside the Clinton Presidential Museum is similar to all the museums, which introduce the contributions of president Clinton as well as the first lady Hillary. There also exhibit some letters between Clinton and Hillary, some personal items and some gifts president received.

Now it is time to drive to the Hot Springs National Park. There are about 55 miles between Little Rock and Hotsprings, which would take about one hour on the road. 

The Hot Springs City and Hot Springs National Park, though share the same name, are two distinct areas. The President Clinton is graduated on the Hot Springs Senior High School located on the Hot Springs City. The Hot Spings National Park not like other national parks, are not that big and do not have so many things to do. However, it seems like have a lot of histories in this small place and tourists could have a basic concept about these on the second floor of [The Hot Springs Mountain Tower][hotspringstower]. Before the arrival of European, there is an Indian tribe lives in this area. At first, only little European decided to live in this area until the hot springs was found. Then, the Hot Springs area came into a period of rapid development. A lot of hotels and spa were build in this area, a lot of success people would like to come to this place to have a holiday, a lot of injured soldiers were here to have their treatment by the hot spring, a lot of hot spring related techniques were invented.

As the limited time I have in the Hot Springs, I only have time to go to the Hot Springs Mountain Tower. On top of the tower, it would be able to see every corner of the Hot Springs City and Hot Springs National Park. There are some trials in the Hot Springs National Park, but as the limited time I had, I would not be able to go over all these trials. If I have time to come back, I will try to walk through all those trials to see if there are really hot springs in the mountain.

By the way, one of the most famous food in the Hot Springs seems like the white fish, which is a must try in the restaurant.
